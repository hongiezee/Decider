# Decider

If you're ever stuck on a decision, psychologists have found that it can be helpful to randomly select an option. The power of the randomly-generated option is that it elicits a gut-feeling response from the user. Users can observe how they felt about the selected option, which helps them ultimately decide ([link1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822000269), [link2](https://kevineikenberry.com/personal-professional-development/need-to-make-a-decision-flip-a-coin/#:~:text=Here%20is%20that%20surprising%20approach,has%20been%20at%20work%20too))

## Functionality 
This Android app allows the user to input 2-4 choices, then the app randomly selects one of the choices.

* The main page has text input fields with a character limit. Clicking away from text input fields closes keyboard.
* Upon clicking the "decide" button, the app will validate that the two required fields are non-empty (if not, will return message).
* If there are 2 or more choices entered, app will randomly pick one of the non-empty choices and show the "winner" in a new dialog screen
* Each time the button is clicked, app re-generates a random winner.
